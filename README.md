**Interpolation**
To implement interpolation I decided to transform the gameover screen, from a starting colour of black, then across the span of two seconds, the GAME OVER screen inverts into a a white colour. My starting state is the black GAMEOVER and the end state is the white GAMEOVER. It is implemented in the vignette glsl shader files.
